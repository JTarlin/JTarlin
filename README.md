**ðŸ’¬ Who am I?**

I'm an engineering physicist by training and degree - a generalist problem solver with expertise in all types of math and science.
That power helps me in my new calling: web development. I build engaging online experiences for the vast communities of the internet.

**ðŸ”­ What am I working on right now?**

If you're interested in following up with some of my projects, check out my website/portfolio at www.jacksontarlin.com, or feel free to poke around in my repos. 

**ðŸŒ± What tech stacks do I know?**

I'm a big fan of clean, beautiful code. Currently I've been enjoying React.js, Node, and JavaScript. I want even cleaner, more beautful code though, so I've been looking into learning Svelte and TypeScript. Here are some of the stacks that I work with/have worked with:
