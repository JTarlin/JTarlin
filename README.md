Why thank you! You are too kind! Thanks for visiting my profile!-->

**ðŸ’¬ Who am I?**

I am a former customer support specialist in the SaaS industry, now looking to enter the industry as a full-stack web developer. Yes, front-end and back-end both!

**ðŸ¤” Why now?**

I am a life-long learner (sorry about the cliche, but it is true!). You could argue that I have spent too much time, not being a developer by being in the customer support industry. True. But I am grateful for being in that field. It allowed me to support my family, learn from the best, and motivated me to finally pursue my passion seriously. I also got to work on many WordPress websites as side hustles in my free time during that period. But the time is now, mainly because I feel more confident than ever, and I just graduated from a BootCamp with the best cohorts ever!

**ðŸ”­ What am I working on right now?**

I am working on a lot of stuff! I am finalizing my learning management system, (take a peek [here](https://ulearn.netlify.app/)), polishing my knowledge on Typescript, Graphql, learning React Native, solving LeetCode problems, spending some time on learning Python and more!

**ðŸŒ± What tech stacks do I know?**

I used to work with PHP, but now I just LOVE javascript. Here are some of the stacks that I work with
